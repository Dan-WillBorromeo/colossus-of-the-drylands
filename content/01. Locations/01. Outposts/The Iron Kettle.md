One of the more industrialized outposts in the region, the **Iron Kettle** is built around a massive mine owned by [[03. Cast/01. Groups/Iron Tusk Corp]]. Because of the talent needed to construct the mining infrastructure, it’s a rustic place full of skilled smiths and crafters, many of whom sell goods to travelers outside their work for Iron Tusk. This need for steel goods has given the smiths more power than Iron Tusk would prefer. But a powerful trade union formed by the smiths keeps them in check and governs “[[03. Cast/01. Groups/The Kettle]],” taking the onus (and liability) off the company.

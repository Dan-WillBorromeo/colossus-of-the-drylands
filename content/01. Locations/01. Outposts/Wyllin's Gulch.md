Besides [[01. Locations/01. Outposts/Pryor]] up to the north, Wylinn's Gulch is one of the oldest outposts in the Drylands region. Founded roughly 40 years ago by [[03. Cast/04. The Dead Ones/Wylinn Hartly]], no train enters or exits the Drylands without first going through its borders. At least, if you're coming from anywhere in the west.

Belching factories were built up the sides of the [[01. Locations/02. Natural Scenery/Twin Turtles]], two great mesas that bordered the burgeoning town, their massive conveyor lifts hauling tons of [[02. Phenomena & Stuff/Essentia\|essentia]] to the manufactories that process the crystals into the conductive batteries most folk use to power their homes, weapons, and all manner of magical items.

Today, with its natural fortifications and wealthy elite, Wyllin’s Gulch is the gatekeeper for anyone approaching [[01. Locations/02. Natural Scenery/Godfell Mountain]] on the western train line. As such, the townspeople either work mining and processing essentia or host money traps that appeal to new fools who come to try their hand at prospecting the crystals.

A wide variety of folks inhabit Wyllin’s Gulch. The arid plains, breathtaking skies, and the possibility of boundless riches attract all types. Living away from the prying eye of larger law enforcement is another perk—while there are sheriffs in Wyllin’s Gulch, they’re paid to protect the mines and manufacturing rather than uphold any version of “justice.” It’s common for outlaw gangs to seek their fortunes by stealing the valuable crystals, while others, who see these mining operations as anathema, destroy the equipment that tears essentia from the ground. But most outlaws find greater success at the smaller essentia outposts than this bastion of dusty fortitude.

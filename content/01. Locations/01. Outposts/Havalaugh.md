The name sounds as cordial as the folks in this encampment. Though there isn’t a permanent building in sight, the tents that form this town stretch for at least a mile. Run by someone known only as **[[03. Cast/03. NPCS/Pickens]]**, Havalaugh is fairly receptive to outsiders. The outpost is considered to host the premier marketplace on the eastern side of the mountain, and its **High Summer Festival** is famous—enough for Havalaugh to nearly quintuple its size for a week. There’s no sheriff in Havalaugh, but anyone who harms a citizen is never heard from again.

Built into a long-abandoned [[02. Phenomena & Stuff/Essentia\|essentia]] mine, **Pryor** is often unnoticed by those who don’t know where to look as they ride by. The folk that live in this insular outpost are not known to welcome guests, but if you have a contact who can get you in their good graces, you’re likely to learn the best tricks of the Drylands from the citizens of Pryor. Most of these families stretch back to the time before the [[02. Phenomena & Stuff/Essentia#Essentia Rush\|Essentia Rush]], when there were only a few folk mining these lands.

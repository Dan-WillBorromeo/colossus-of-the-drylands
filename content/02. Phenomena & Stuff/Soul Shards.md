No one knows exactly where each soul shard is located, but regions overrun with [[03. Cast/01. Groups/Abberations\|abberations]] and supercharged [[02. Phenomena & Stuff/Essentia\|essentia]] indicate that a shard is nearby. When [[03. Cast/03. NPCS/Kudamat, the First Doom\|Kudamat]] locates a soul shard and begins siphoning power from it, the ground around it quakes with a single, powerful tremor, and the vein of essentia supercharged by his power glows brightly, day and night. This helps the locals pinpoint the soul shardâ€™s location with more accuracy, so to prevent it from being found, Kudamat simultaneously creates a sentinel: a [[03. Cast/01. Groups/The Children of Godfell\|Colossus]] who stalks and guards that entire region.

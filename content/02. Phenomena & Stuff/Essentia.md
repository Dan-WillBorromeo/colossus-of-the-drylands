The source of all magic in the Drylands. Without it, the mortals inhabiting these realms may have never been able to harnessed magic. Followers of both the Old and New gods claim that essentia is formed from the spilt lifeblood of the divine.

# Essentia Rush
An event that started roughly 40 years before the present day. [[Wylinn Hartly]], a businessman and pioneer, discovered large deposits of naturally occuring Essentia in the Drylands region. He would then go on to find [[Wylinn's Gulch]] to the westernmost region, near a rich vein of essentia. They built factories running up the sides of [[Twin Turtles]], two mesas bordering the town and providing natural cover.

As Wylinn unearthed more and more of the coveted crytals, more and more moguls came. They built processing plants, railroads, mines, and outposts. With them came bandits looking for the haul of a lifetime, and soon came the sheriffs and constables.

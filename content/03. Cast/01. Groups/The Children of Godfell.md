Each of [[03. Cast/03. NPCS/Kudamat, the First Doom\|Kudamat]]’s nine [[02. Phenomena & Stuff/Soul Shards]] are protected by a colossus known as a **Child of Godfell**. These beings are physical manifestations of the god’s will, hellbent on protecting their soul shard as its power is siphoned back to the mountain. Formed by elements of the soul shard’s surroundings, each is unique in personality, form, and capabilities.

While there are only nine, according to myth, there have been many names and forms given to them over the ages. Keep in mind, however, that these are only what the mortals *think* the Children will be.

# Prophesized Children of Godfell
- **Aandira, the One Who Devours**: Her form is a mix of humanoid and spider, and she scurries across the Drylands on bent-back limb with a dozen mouths of broken teeth.
- **Aikar, Shepherd of the Meek**: This bipedal colossus has two arms affixed with bladed shields, allowing them to deflect and deliver blows with ease. Aikar’s howl can stop living creatures in their tracks.
- **Aphedos, the Creeping Darkness**: Aphedos is formed from thousands of flies that operate independently. Impossible to climb, he must be brought down by alternate means.
- **Balorma, the Blooming Hornwolf**: This wolf bears elk horns formed of flourishing plant life. When she steps, she plants roots that suck the life from all they touch.
- **Chakantis, He Who Knows the End**: This crystalline beetle’s wingbeats rain down deadly shards onto the ground, and his abdomen can vibrate at high frequency, shattering even stone.
- **Daktadae, the Cleaver**: A massive steel rhinoceros formed from a steam train, a cleaver emerging from his head instead of a horn. He seeks vengeance upon those who’ve harmed him in the past.
- **Eriphisia, the Radiant Light of Eternal Cleansing**: A crystalline statue whose dozens of eyes cast blinding light upon the world. They reflect the sun upon victims as a ray of white, hot death.
- **Ga’mor, the Shade of Quick Death**: Ga’mor is formed from the shadows of mountains, buildings, and people. When this amalgam steps into new darkness, they can adjust their shape to match the bounds of the shadow.
- **Heladra, Sower of Sorrows**: This cloaked figure weeps waterfalls from unseen eyes, flooding the land wherever she travels.

- **Kelir, the Virulent Hate and Her Hundred, Hundred Children**: A crablike, mountainous beast whose children scurry in and around her, bringing food as tribute.
- **Mirmett, the Lover of the Hollow Hearts**: This giant humanoid cage places enemies inside themself to be killed or eaten by the creatures that live within them.
- **Moraidus, the Keeper of Graves**: This centipede is formed from grave dirt and tombstones. Their arms are made of skeletons that hang from their composite form, reaching and scrabbling for anything that comes near.
- **Nocte, the Invisible Tide**: Imperceptible to the eye, Nocte swims through the ground like a fish through water and attacks from below, pulling his victims into an early grave.
- **Oosha, Eerrae, and Yyisu, Three Who Parse Infinity**: These three humanoid figures can fight separately or come together as one terrifying form. They cut their victims into pieces with rusted blades.
- **Poy, Sky Skimmer of the Dust Sea**: This massive shoebill stork is formed from the dust of the Drylands and traps enemies in their cavernous beak.
- **Quelle, the Innocent Pain**: A feline creature covered in thousands of burrowing tendrils, Quelle is fascinated by living beings and tears their enemies apart to look inside.
- **Syan’til, the Serpent of the Last Light**: A serpent of lightning, Syan’til races down from the sky to strike with blazing speed.
- **Takkan, the Bone Bearer**: Built from hundreds of bones from deep within the earth, Takkan’s form is ever-shifting and ever-grinding as she moves.
- **Usandi, the Bear of Five Faces**: Able to see in all directions, Usandi has a ring of snapping teeth around his neck, sharpened spine bones jutting out of his back, and thrashing claws running up his limbs.
- **Vian and Naiv, the Makers of Undoing**: These vespertilian beasts corrode what they touch until it falls to dust. They can only be killed by simultaneously striking weak points on both creatures.
- **Xehamras, the Last Breath**: Xehamras suffocates his victims, consuming their dying breath to increase his power, all while barking raspy laughter from his coyote head.
- **Zuudra, the Many Arms of Calamity**: This cephalopod has eight writhing limbs that rapidly shift between hardened stone spikes and rivers of flowing magma.

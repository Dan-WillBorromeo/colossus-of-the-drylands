From the divine power surging through the veins of [[02. Phenomena & Stuff/Essentia\|essentia]] come new and terrible beasts. These **aberrations** are smaller than the [[03. Cast/01. Groups/The Children of Godfell\|Colossi]], but share the same goal: keep all creatures away from the [[02. Phenomena & Stuff/Soul Shards]]. Some even resemble the colossi they serve, wielding similar forms or abilities as their titanic counterparts.

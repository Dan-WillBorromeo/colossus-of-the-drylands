The creators of the **Mortal Realms**, the **Hallows Above**, and the **Circles Below**. Some believe that, when the [[03. Cast/01. Groups/New God\|New Gods]] rose, the Forgotten Gods were [[02. Phenomena & Stuff/History of the Gods\|ill-equipped]] to fight someone on their level and promptly fell. The strongest among them, [[03. Cast/03. NPCS/Kudamat, the First Doom\|Kudamat]], had their soul split into [[02. Phenomena & Stuff/Soul Shards\|nine pieces]] and entrusted to mortals to guard over. It is said that the rest were buried in the Mortal Realms, or interred in the Circles Below.

When the [[02. Phenomena & Stuff/Prophecy of the Drylands God]] is fulfilled, Kudamat will bring back the rest of their kin and wage war once more against the New Gods. Some believe this will lead to a new age of prosperity, while others believe this will end the world as we know it.

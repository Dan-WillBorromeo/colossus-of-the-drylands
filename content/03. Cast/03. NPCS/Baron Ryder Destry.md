**Baron Ryder Destry (He/Him)**, his name, not his title (yet), claims the [[03. Cast/01. Groups/The Children of Godfell\|beast]] is supercharging the magic within the [[02. Phenomena & Stuff/Essentia\|essentia]]. He's wanting folk who'd keep it in the mines. He is a *Human/Elf*. 

Destry swears his factory guard can keep [[01. Locations/01. Outposts/Wyllin's Gulch]] safe, and heâ€™ll keep his teams mining the powerful essentia night and day.

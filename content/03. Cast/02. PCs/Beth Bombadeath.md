# Background

Beth Bombadeath, born and raised in [[01. Locations/01. Outposts/Wyllin's Gulch]], is the 3rd generation co-owner of the **[[01. Locations/01. Outposts/Wyllin's Gulch#Locations Here\|Bombadeath Bed & Bowls]]**, an inn famous for their very spicy **Bombadeath curry**. Despite her smaller stature, Beth is a mean cook with an even meaner right hook (the punch, not an actual hook). When Beth is not in the kitchen, she’s out warding away various parties that threaten the survival of the inn.

As the eldest of five, Beth was trained in combat by her father since childhood, especially since Wyllin's Gulch was always rife with rowdy criminals and corrupt government officials seeking to take over local establishments. In her teens, she was a central figure of resistance against outsiders who aimed to gentrify Wyllin's Gulch, turning her into somewhat of an icon among BB&B’s loyal patrons.

Upon hearing word for an expedition party to put an end to the [[03. Cast/01. Groups/The Children of Godfell\|colossi]] threatening her hometown, she passed down her chef apron to her brother, **Seth**, and took up her sword and armor once more.

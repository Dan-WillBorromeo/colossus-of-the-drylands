# Background
Lady (and it is a formal moniker, not her name) **Briar Simmons** is the only daughter in a family of 7 theatre guild professionals. The middle child among 5 children, her brothers caused more than a ruckus when her parents approved of a marriage proposal between her and [[03. Cast/04. The Dead Ones/Rhett Concord]]. Ripped from her previous life; performing, comfortable, cared for, Briar now starts a new life in [[01. Locations/01. Outposts/Wyllin's Gulch]] with a number of teenage children to care for and an apathetic husband to please. She was 25.

Lady Briar Concord nee Simmons becomes a widow at 30 with the recent death of her husband Rhett Concord. With her late husband's passing she is now left to care for his teenage-to-young adult children alone. She's tried her best to raise them in the last 5 years she's been married to this family, but now with no husband to please nor young children to worry over, Briar has the chance to try out the life she wanted before marriage.

Maybe she's relieved, happy at her recent loss, maybe she mourns as deep as she dresses, the town can only ever assume.

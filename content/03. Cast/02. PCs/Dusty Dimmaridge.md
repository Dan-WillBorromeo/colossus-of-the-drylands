# Background

Born in a dusty outpost, Dusty grew up idolizing traveling gunslingers seeing them as larger than life heroes. He and his best friend **Din Le’Berg** were orphans, scraping out a living from age 15, when they were removed from the orphanage, by cleaning shoes, hauling crates, and pitching in at the market. They shared a humble rented room, bound by friendship and ambition.

As they matured, Din hungered for stability and left for the [[01. Locations/01. Outposts/Wyllin's Gulch]], where he became a deputy. Dusty, alone at heart but full of purpose, wandered the drylands in search of excitement and meaning and slowly became the cowboy hero he always imagined, crowing the title of “**Owner of the Gunslinger’s Guild**” (even if he’s the only member).

Dusty rides between mesas and outposts, offering help wherever needed hauling crates, shielding miners, etc while leading with a booming greeting of his Guild’s name.

Dusty’s legend grew more when he saved townsfolk from a catastrophic train derailment his impromptu heroics seared his name into local lore. But tragedy struck when the first colossus emerged in the main gulch. Dusty visited Din in the hopes of reunion only to learn that Din perished in the line of duty as the [[03. Cast/01. Groups/The Children of Godfell\|monstrous]] threat rampaged. Guilt and grief now fuel every bullet. Now,  His mission to help is part redemption, part spectacle always driven by that lingering ache for the friend he lost.
